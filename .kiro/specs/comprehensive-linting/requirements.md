# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for implementing a comprehensive linting and code quality system for the Discord bot project. The system will integrate multiple linting tools (ruff, yamllint, shellcheck, markdownlint, dotenv-linter, actionlint, and gitleaks) to ensure consistent code quality, security, and maintainability across all project files.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Python Code Quality Enhancement

**User Story:** As a developer, I want modern Python linting that catches more issues and runs faster than traditional tools, so that I can maintain high code quality with minimal overhead.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run Python linting THEN the system SHALL use ruff as the primary linter
2. WHEN ruff detects fixable issues THEN the system SHALL automatically fix them when requested
3. WHEN I format Python code THEN the system SHALL use ruff format instead of black/isort
4. WHEN linting finds critical syntax errors THEN the system SHALL fail CI checks immediately
5. WHEN I run comprehensive linting THEN the system SHALL check for 174+ rule violations
6. WHEN legacy tools are needed THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with black/isort/flake8

### Requirement 2: Multi-Language File Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all project files (YAML, shell scripts, Markdown, .env files) to be validated for syntax and best practices, so that I can prevent configuration errors and maintain documentation quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I modify YAML files THEN the system SHALL validate syntax and formatting with yamllint
2. WHEN I edit shell scripts THEN the system SHALL check for security issues and best practices with shellcheck
3. WHEN I update Markdown documentation THEN the system SHALL enforce consistent formatting with markdownlint
4. WHEN I modify .env files THEN the system SHALL validate syntax and detect common issues with dotenv-linter
5. WHEN I change GitHub Actions workflows THEN the system SHALL validate workflow syntax with actionlint
6. WHEN any validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with fix suggestions

### Requirement 3: Automated Issue Resolution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to automatically fix common code quality issues, so that I can focus on logic rather than formatting and style.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run the format command THEN the system SHALL automatically fix Python formatting issues
2. WHEN I run linting with fix flag THEN the system SHALL resolve auto-fixable violations
3. WHEN the system fixes issues THEN it SHALL preserve code functionality and logic
4. WHEN auto-fixes are applied THEN the system SHALL report what was changed
5. WHEN unsafe fixes are available THEN the system SHALL require explicit opt-in
6. WHEN fixes cannot be applied automatically THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidance

### Requirement 4: CI/CD Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want linting to be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline, so that code quality issues are caught before they reach production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to the repository THEN the system SHALL run comprehensive linting checks
2. WHEN critical issues are found THEN the system SHALL fail the CI build
3. WHEN linting passes THEN the system SHALL allow the build to continue
4. WHEN GitHub Actions are modified THEN the system SHALL validate workflow syntax
5. WHEN shell scripts are changed THEN the system SHALL run security checks
6. WHEN the CI runs THEN it SHALL use the same linting configuration as local development

### Requirement 5: Developer Experience Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a streamlined workflow for running quality checks, so that I can easily maintain code quality without complex commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I want to run all checks THEN the system SHALL provide a single `make check-all` command
2. WHEN I want to format code THEN the system SHALL provide a simple `make format` command
3. WHEN I want Python-only linting THEN the system SHALL provide a `make lint-python` command
4. WHEN I want legacy tool compatibility THEN the system SHALL provide `make format-legacy` and `make lint-legacy` commands
5. WHEN commands run THEN the system SHALL provide clear progress indicators and results
6. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide actionable error messages with fix suggestions

### Requirement 6: Security and Best Practices Enforcement

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the linting system to enforce security best practices and detect potential vulnerabilities, so that the codebase remains secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I commit code THEN the system SHALL scan for hardcoded secrets with gitleaks
2. WHEN Python code is analyzed THEN the system SHALL check for security anti-patterns
3. WHEN shell scripts are validated THEN the system SHALL detect security vulnerabilities
4. WHEN configuration files are checked THEN the system SHALL identify insecure settings
5. WHEN security issues are found THEN the system SHALL provide severity levels and fix guidance
6. WHEN false positives occur THEN the system SHALL allow for proper exclusion configuration

### Requirement 7: Performance and Efficiency

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the linting system to run quickly and efficiently, so that it doesn't slow down my development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run Python linting THEN ruff SHALL complete 10-100x faster than traditional tools
2. WHEN multiple linting tools run THEN they SHALL execute in parallel where possible
3. WHEN CI runs linting THEN it SHALL complete within reasonable time limits
4. WHEN linting runs repeatedly THEN it SHALL cache results where appropriate
5. WHEN only specific files change THEN the system SHALL only lint changed files when possible
6. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL provide profiling information

### Requirement 8: Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want centralized, maintainable configuration for all linting tools, so that rules are consistent and easy to update.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN linting tools are configured THEN each SHALL have a dedicated configuration file
2. WHEN rules conflict between tools THEN the system SHALL provide clear resolution
3. WHEN configuration changes THEN the system SHALL validate the new settings
4. WHEN team standards evolve THEN configuration SHALL be easily updatable
5. WHEN new team members join THEN configuration SHALL be self-documenting
6. WHEN tools are updated THEN configuration SHALL remain compatible or provide migration guidance

### Requirement 9: Legacy Code Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to gradually improve existing code quality without breaking changes, so that I can maintain system stability while enhancing quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN legacy code exists THEN the system SHALL provide incremental improvement paths
2. WHEN breaking changes are suggested THEN the system SHALL allow gradual adoption
3. WHEN old tools are still needed THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility
4. WHEN migration occurs THEN the system SHALL provide clear upgrade paths
5. WHEN conflicts arise THEN the system SHALL prioritize stability over perfection
6. WHEN legacy issues are found THEN the system SHALL categorize them by priority

### Requirement 10: Reporting and Metrics

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear reporting on code quality metrics and improvements, so that I can track progress and identify areas needing attention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN linting completes THEN the system SHALL provide summary statistics
2. WHEN issues are found THEN the system SHALL categorize them by severity and type
3. WHEN fixes are applied THEN the system SHALL report what was improved
4. WHEN trends emerge THEN the system SHALL highlight recurring issues
5. WHEN quality improves THEN the system SHALL acknowledge progress
6. WHEN integration with external tools is needed THEN the system SHALL provide compatible output formats
