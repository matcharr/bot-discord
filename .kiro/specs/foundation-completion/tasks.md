  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5_

- [ ] 3. Enhance bot startup with comprehensive validation and error handling
  - Improve main.py startup sequence with step-by-step validation
  - Add detailed cog loading with individual failure handling and recovery
  - Implement startup health checks that validate all components before going online
  - Create startup success confirmation with component status reporting
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5_

- [ ] 4. Create integration tests for Discord bot functionality
  - Write integration tests for moderation commands using mock Discord objects
