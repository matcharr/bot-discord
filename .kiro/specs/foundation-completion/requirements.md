# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The foundation completion feature ensures that the Discord moderation bot has a complete, reliable, and production-ready infrastructure. This feature addresses the remaining gaps in the foundational infrastructure to enable efficient feature development without workflow and setup issues. The bot already has strong foundations including database layer, development environment, code quality tools, documentation, git workflow, bot architecture, testing framework, configuration system, and utilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper encryption keys configured in all environments, so that sensitive data can be securely encrypted and decrypted throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the development environment is initialized THEN the system SHALL generate proper encryption keys for .env.development
2. WHEN the test environment is initialized THEN the system SHALL have test-specific encryption keys in .env.test
3. WHEN encryption keys are generated THEN the system SHALL document the key generation process for future reference
4. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL validate that all required encryption keys are present and properly formatted

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the database to be properly initialized and tested in all environments, so that data operations work reliably end-to-end.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the database is initialized THEN the system SHALL create all required tables properly
2. WHEN the application connects to the database THEN the system SHALL successfully establish connections in development, test, and production environments
3. WHEN data is encrypted and stored THEN the system SHALL successfully decrypt and retrieve the data
4. WHEN the full test suite runs THEN all database tests SHALL pass consistently
5. WHEN database operations are performed THEN the system SHALL handle connection errors gracefully

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the bot to start up reliably with all components loaded, so that the application is ready to handle Discord events and commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the bot starts THEN the system SHALL load without any startup errors
2. WHEN the bot initializes THEN all cogs SHALL load successfully
3. WHEN health checks are performed THEN the system SHALL report healthy status for all components
4. WHEN the bot shuts down THEN the system SHALL gracefully close all connections and resources
5. WHEN startup fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating the failure reason

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a moderator, I want core moderation commands to work properly with the database, so that I can effectively moderate the Discord server.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a moderator uses the /warn command THEN the system SHALL store the warning in the encrypted database
2. WHEN a moderator uses the /warnings command THEN the system SHALL retrieve and display stored warnings
3. WHEN moderation commands are executed THEN the system SHALL validate user permissions properly
4. WHEN moderation actions occur THEN the system SHALL log all actions to the audit system
5. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error messages to moderators

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a streamlined development startup process, so that I can quickly begin working on the bot without complex setup procedures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting development THEN the system SHALL provide a single command to start all required services
2. WHEN the development environment is running THEN the system SHALL provide a status dashboard showing component health
3. WHEN code changes are made THEN the system SHALL support hot-reload functionality
4. WHEN database reset is needed THEN the system SHALL provide a reliable database reset and seed workflow
5. WHEN development setup fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear troubleshooting information

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing and quality assurance tools, so that code quality is maintained and regressions are prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN bot commands are tested THEN the system SHALL provide integration tests for Discord.py functionality
2. WHEN performance is evaluated THEN the system SHALL include performance benchmarks
3. WHEN code is committed THEN the CI/CD pipeline SHALL run successfully
4. WHEN tests are executed THEN the system SHALL provide clear test results and coverage reports
5. WHEN quality checks fail THEN the system SHALL prevent deployment until issues are resolved

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want enhanced debugging and monitoring capabilities, so that I can efficiently troubleshoot issues and monitor system health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the system SHALL provide enhanced logging for development environments
2. WHEN testing functionality THEN the system SHALL include debug commands for manual testing
3. WHEN monitoring system health THEN the system SHALL provide a health monitoring dashboard
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL track and report errors with sufficient context
5. WHEN performance issues arise THEN the system SHALL provide monitoring data to identify bottlenecks
