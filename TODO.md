## üî• High Priority - Foundation Completion
- [ ] **Foundation testing** - Verify bot starts and core commands work end-to-end
- [ ] **Discord bot token setup** - Configure development Discord bot
- [ ] **Database integration testing** - Test warning system with real Discord data
- [ ] **Load missing cogs** - Add remaining cogs to main.py load list
- [ ] **Complete test coverage** - Write tests for admin.py, anti_raid.py, etc.

## üöÄ Medium Priority - Feature Development  
- [ ] **Confirmation prompts** - Add confirmations for destructive operations (ban, kick, purge)
- [ ] More granular permissions per command (custom permission system)
- [ ] Integrate new permission validation utilities

## üöÄ Medium Priority - Cool Features
- [ ] **Slash commands migration** - Modernize to Discord slash commands
- [ ] **Admin dashboard** - Commands for stats, active mutes, server overview
- [ ] **Advanced auto-moderation** - Links detection, caps lock, spam patterns
- [ ] Implement warning limits with automatic actions (auto-mute after X warnings)
- [ ] Add bulk moderation commands (bulk ban, bulk role assignment)
- [ ] Integrate audit logging system in all moderation commands

## Low Priority
- [ ] Add role expiration functionality
- [ ] Implement temporary role assignments
- [ ] Create custom embed templates for different log types
- [ ] Add reaction-based role assignment system
- [ ] Implement auto-moderation for links, caps, etc.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Improvements
- [ ] **Health check system** - Monitoring endpoints and bot status
- [ ] **Deployment guide** - Docker, systemd, complete setup documentation
- [ ] Create backup/restore functionality for warnings
- [ ] Add metrics and monitoring
- [ ] Implement database migrations system (when DB is implemented)

## Testing & Quality
- [x] Write unit tests for config and moderation modules
- [x] Add code coverage reporting (pytest-cov)
- [x] Set up CI testing across multiple Python versions
- [ ] Write unit tests for remaining cogs (admin, anti-raid, etc.)
- [ ] Add integration tests
- [ ] Add performance testing

## Documentation
- [x] Create comprehensive Git workflow documentation
- [x] Add inline code documentation for core modules
- [ ] Create deployment guide
- [ ] Add troubleshooting section to README
- [ ] Document all available bot commands
- [ ] Create API documentation for utility functions

## üéØ Next Sprint Candidates (Prioritized)
1. **Tests Coverage** - Safe, immediate value, good learning
2. **Confirmation Prompts** - Simple UX improvement, prevents accidents  
3. **Slash Commands** - Modernizes bot, better Discord integration
4. **Deployment Docs** - Helps community adoption
5. **Database Migration** - Major improvement but needs careful planning
