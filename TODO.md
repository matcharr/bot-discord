## High Priority
- [ ] Database storage for warnings instead of JSON files
- [ ] More granular permissions per command (custom permission system)
- [ ] Integrate new permission validation utilities

## Medium Priority  
- [ ] Add confirmation prompts for destructive operations (ban, kick, purge)
- [ ] Implement warning limits with automatic actions (auto-mute after X warnings)
- [ ] Add bulk moderation commands (bulk ban, bulk role assignment)
- [ ] Create admin dashboard commands (view stats, active mutes, etc.)
- [ ] Integrate audit logging system in all moderation commands

## Low Priority
- [ ] Add role expiration functionality

## Testing & Quality
- [x] Write unit tests for config and moderation modules
- [x] Add code coverage reporting (pytest-cov)
- [x] Set up CI testing across multiple Python versions
- [ ] Write unit tests for remaining cogs (admin, anti-raid, etc.)
- [ ] Add integration tests
- [ ] Add performance testing

## Documentation
- [x] Create comprehensive Git workflow documentation
- [x] Add inline code documentation for core modules
- [ ] Create deployment guide
- [ ] Add troubleshooting section to README
- [ ] Document all available bot commands
- [ ] Create API documentation for utility functions
