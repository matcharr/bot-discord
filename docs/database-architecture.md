# Database Architecture

## Overview

This project is migrating from JSON file storage to a PostgreSQL database for improved reliability, performance, and security.

## Security Features

### Data Protection
- **Encryption**: Sensitive data is encrypted at rest using industry-standard algorithms
- **Hashing**: User identifiers are hashed with salt for privacy protection
- **Access Control**: Database access is restricted and audited

### GDPR Compliance
- **Right to be forgotten**: User data can be completely removed on request
- **Data minimization**: Only necessary data is stored
- **Anonymization**: Personal identifiers are not stored in plain text

## Architecture

### Database Schema
- Secure data models with encrypted fields
- Indexed lookups for performance
- Audit trails for moderation actions

### Migration Strategy
- Gradual migration from existing JSON storage
- Data validation and integrity checks
- Rollback capabilities

### Performance Optimizations
- Connection pooling
- Efficient indexing strategy
- Query optimization

## Implementation

The migration will be implemented in phases:

1. **Infrastructure Setup**: Database provisioning and configuration
2. **Security Layer**: Encryption and hashing utilities
3. **Data Models**: SQLAlchemy models with security features
4. **Migration Scripts**: Safe data transfer from JSON to database
5. **Code Integration**: Update existing moderation commands
6. **Testing & Validation**: Comprehensive testing of all features

## Benefits

- **Reliability**: No more file corruption issues
- **Performance**: Faster queries and better scalability
- **Security**: Enhanced data protection and privacy
- **Maintainability**: Cleaner code architecture
- **Compliance**: GDPR and privacy regulation compliance

## Development
